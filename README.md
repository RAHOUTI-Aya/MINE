# GeneCure: Genomic mutation prediction (HUNTINGTON disease)

Welcome to the our project! This project aims to identify and predict mutations in DNA sequences, specifically focusing on Huntington's disease. The project utilizes AI and machine learning techniques to analyze DNA sequences and predict mutation risks based on specific patterns.

## Introduction

Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the HTT gene. This project aims to predict the risk of developing Huntington's disease by analyzing DNA sequences for specific patterns and mutations.

## Features

- DNA sequence analysis
- Mutation prediction using LSTM models
- Embedding techniques for feature extraction
- Support for long DNA sequences
- GitHub documentation for easy collaboration
