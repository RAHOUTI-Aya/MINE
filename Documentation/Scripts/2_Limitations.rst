2. Project limitations:
===========
  
  The main problem faced throughout this project was mainly related to limited data ressources, since DNA sequences containing the Hntington disease do not usually come from different individuals, but a very long decomposed DNA sequence of a one and only person.

  The second challenge is the DNA sequences length variation: It is important to ensure that the data  does not go through any modifications that could impact the real DNA sequence that comes from real genomic information.
