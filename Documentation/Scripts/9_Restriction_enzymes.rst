9.  Restriction enzymes usage possibility:
===========


In our project, we provide information about the positions of CAG sequences within DNA strands, along with the nucleotides that come before and after them. This detailed mapping is crucial for medical purposes, as it facilitates the precise addition of restriction enzymes. Knowing the exact location of these sequences and their surrounding context helps researchers target specific sites accurately, enabling effective manipulation and analysis of the DNA for further applications.

Selection of Restriction Enzymes:
------------------------------

Choose the appropriate restriction enzymes based on the specific recognition sequences within the DNA strand. Consult enzyme catalogs and reference materials to ensure compatibility with your DNA sequence.
