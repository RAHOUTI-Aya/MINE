6. Data labeling : 
===========

6.1  CAG count:
----------

To be able to label each DNA sequence, it is necessary to link the DNA sequences to the number of repeated CAG nucleotide triplets.

6.2  Labeling:
----------

Labeling the sequence based on the number of CAG repeats:
CAGcount < = 35: Normal
36 < = CAGcount < = 39: Intermediate
40 < = CAGcount < = 55: Reduced_Penetrance
Sinon: Full_Mutation
