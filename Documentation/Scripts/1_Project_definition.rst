1. Project definition
===========

Overview:
----------

This project aims to develop an AI model to predict mutations in DNA sequences associated with Huntington's disease. By analyzing genetic data, the model predicts the likelihood of mutations that contribute to the onset and progression of the disease.
This project not only aims to advance the understanding of genetic mutations associated with Huntington's disease but also aspires to contribute to the broader field of medical genetics by providing a tool that could aid in early diagnosis and intervention strategies.

Huntington disease:
----------

Huntington's disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that results in the progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain. It is caused by a genetic mutation specifically associated with the HTT (huntingtin) gene, which is located on chromosome 4. The mutation involves an abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats within the HTT gene. In a typical HTT gene, the CAG sequence repeats 10 to 35 times. However, in individuals with Huntington's disease, this sequence is repeated 36 times or more, leading to the production of an altered huntingtin protein.
 
However, predicting the severity of the mutation's development is not as controllable, as the CAG sequences might be more frequent in the child's DNA sequence while being less impactful in the parent's.
