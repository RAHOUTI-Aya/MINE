1. Project definition
===========

Overview:
----------

This project aims to develop an AI model to predict mutations in DNA sequences associated with Huntington's disease. By analyzing genetic data, the model predicts the likelihood of mutations that contribute to the onset and progression of the disease.
This project not only aims to advance the understanding of genetic mutations associated with Huntington's disease but also aspires to contribute to the broader field of medical genetics by providing a tool that could aid in early diagnosis and intervention strategies.

Huntington’s disease:
----------

Introduction to Huntington’s Disease: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Huntington's disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that results in the progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain. It is caused by a genetic mutation specifically associated with the HTT (huntingtin) gene, which is located on chromosome 4. The mutation involves an abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats within the HTT gene. In a typical HTT gene, the CAG sequence repeats 10 to 35 times. However, in individuals with Huntington's disease, this sequence is repeated 36 times or more, leading to the production of an altered huntingtin protein.
 
However, predicting the severity of the mutation's development is not as controllable, as the CAG sequences might be more frequent in the child's DNA sequence while being less impactful in the parent's.

Genetic Cause of Huntington’s Disease:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The root cause of Huntington's disease lies in a mutation within the HTT (huntingtin) gene, located on chromosome 4. This gene is responsible for producing the huntingtin protein, which is crucial for the normal functioning of nerve cells. In individuals with Huntington’s disease, the HTT gene contains an abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats. Normally, the CAG sequence is repeated 10 to 35 times in the gene, but in those with Huntington’s disease, the sequence repeats 36 times or more. This abnormal expansion leads to the production of a mutated huntingtin protein that accumulates in brain cells, causing damage over time.

Mutation Characteristics and Effects:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CAG repeat expansion within the HTT gene is the key factor in the onset and progression of Huntington's disease. The greater the number of CAG repeats, the earlier the onset of symptoms and the more severe the disease's progression. However, predicting the exact severity of the mutation can be challenging. Factors like the number of CAG repeats can vary between generations, which means a person’s DNA might carry a higher number of repeats compared to their parents, resulting in more pronounced symptoms. In some cases, the severity may be influenced by environmental factors or other genetic elements, making it difficult to predict the disease's exact progression.
