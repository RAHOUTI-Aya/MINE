10. Access and Execute Our Data Analysis Notebook on Google Colab
=============================================================

We have made our Jupyter notebook available for easy access and execution via Google Colab. Google Colab allows you to run the notebook without any local setup, and it provides a powerful, free cloud-based environment for running Python code.

To explore our data analysis workflow, simply click on the link below. You will be directed to Google Colab, where you can interact with the notebook, run the cells, and even modify the code for your own analysis.

**Whatâ€™s in the notebook:**
- **Data Loading**: We demonstrate how to load and process datasets.

- **Data Exploration**: Visualize and explore the data with interactive plots.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement and evaluate various models to understand the results.

- **Results**: We present the final outcomes and analyses from our models.

By using Google Colab, you can also easily collaborate with us or anyone else, as the notebook is stored online and can be shared in real-time.
